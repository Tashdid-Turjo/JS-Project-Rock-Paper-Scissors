# 🎮 Rock Paper Scissors — My First Web Project

This is a simple **Rock Paper Scissors** game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
Users can select Rock, Paper, or Scissors through buttons or keyboard shortcuts, and the computer generates a random choice each round.
The game also supports round limits, score tracking, animations, and keyboard interactions.

This is my first raw project, created while learning JavaScript and DOM manipulation.

## 📌 Notes

This was created as my first small project while learning JavaScript.
It's not a full application, but it is more than a simple task — it qualifies as a small beginner project, especially because it includes:

✔ DOM Manipulation
✔ Event Handling
✔ Animations
✔ Game Logic
✔ Keyboard shortcuts
✔ GitHub Pages Deployment
